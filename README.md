# Hash Function Encryption
A hash function is a mathematical function that takes in input data and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a "digest" that is unique to the unique values of the input data.

#About this Project

This project implements a hash function in python , which takes in input data and returns a hash value. The hash function is designed to have the following properties:

Deterministic: Given the same input, it will always return the same output.

Fixed-Size Output: The output is a fixed-size string, regardless of the size of the input data.

Uniqueness: It is computationally infeasible to generate two different inputs that produce the same hash value (also known as a "collision").

#Usage

To use the hash function, simply call the function hash() with the input data as an argument. The input data can be a string, a number, or any other data type. The output will be a string of characters with a fixed length.
